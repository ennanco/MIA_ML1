    "# Introduction to Julia Language\n",
    "\n",
    "For the implementation of the practice exercises, there are several options in terms of programming language.  Among the many available options, we will consider the following three languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Matlab** is a scientific programming language with many years of development. It has the advantage of offering a large number of modules (called Toolboxes) for almost any scientific or technical task, along with excellent documentation. This makes it a suitable language for beginners. However, its main disadvantage is that it requires a paid license, which limits its use in many companies. As a result, it is less commonly used than Python in industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python** is undoubtedly the most widely used language in data science and machine learning. It is modern and simple, with a vast ecosystem of modules and extensive documentation. Although it doesn't quite match Matlab in terms of scientific features or numerical performance, it is free, open-source, and general-purpose. Notably, key deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch were first developed for Python, significantly expanding its community. Other machine learning tools, such as Scikit-learn, also make it a strong option. However, since it is not a scientific language by design, numerical efficiency depends on libraries like NumPy, which introduces performance limitations compared to natively vectorized languages.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Julia** is a relatively new scientific programming language developed at MIT. Although its first stable release is only a few years old, it is rapidly evolving. Julia aims to combine the scientific strengths of Matlab with the simplicity and openness of Python, while providing better performance than both. Despite its youth, the number of available packages is growing quickly. However, its community and industry adoption are still smaller compared to Python and Matlab\n",
    "\n",
    "As has been indicated, it is a language that does not yet have a large presence at the enterprise level, however, this is mitigated by three important factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Having acquired Python language skills in other subjects, this subject provides an opportunity to learn a scientific language that completes the knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Several prestigious institutions, such as Berkeley, Stanford, and MIT, recommend and teach Julia due to its fine-grained performance control and suitability for research and experimentation..\n",
    "\n",
    "* Although Python is the most widely used language at the enterprise level, the Scikit-Learn library is also available in Julia.  Learning Julia in this course also strengthens understanding of libraries like Scikit-learn, which are available in both Julia and Python, enabling students to apply their knowledge seamlessly across both languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia installation is pretty straightforward, whether using precompiled binaries or compiling from source. Download and install Julia by following the instructions at [https://julialang.org/downloads/].\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Older Mac users**: Installing Julia might be troublesome due to deprecated compilers. In case of errors during installation, it might be worth trying to install it via [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/julia/). After MacPorts [installation](https://www.macports.org/install.php/), Julia can be installed just by `sudo port install julia`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It could be worth to also install jupyter in a local environment to perform some test. This can be done by executing the following command, if you do not have it already installed."

    "## Suggested Project Structure for Practical Work\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure clarity, maintainability, and reproducibility, it is strongly recommended to organise your course projects using a structured folder layout. Here is a suggested directory structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "/ML1/\n",
    "│\n",
    "├── environment/ ← Contains the Julia environment files\n",
    "│ ├── Project.toml\n",
    "│ └── Manifest.toml\n",
    "│\n",
    "├── notebooks/ ← Jupyter notebooks for development and experimentation\n",
    "│ ├── 00_environment_setup.ipynb\n",
    "│ └── ... (other notebooks)\n",
    "│\n",
    "└── scripts/ ← Julia scripts for reusable or production code\n",
    "  └── train_model.jl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use this structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Isolation**: All dependencies are managed inside `environment/` to avoid conflicts and ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "- **Separation of concerns**: Notebooks are used for interactive exploration and documentation; scripts are for finalised or automated code.\n",
    "- **Portability**: You (and others) can easily clone the repository, activate the environment, and reproduce your results.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: This layout scales well as your project grows.\n",

    "      julia --project=environment/ scripts/train_model.jl\n",
