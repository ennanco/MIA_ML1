    "# Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important issues in Machine Learning is to understand the difference between training and testing errors. The training process will allow the ANN parameters (weights and bias) to be modified to minimise the loss in the **set of patterns used for training**.  If this set of patterns is sufficiently representative, then the ANN will perform well in its working environment, i.e. with new patterns that are not in the training set.  On the other hand, if this set of patterns has not been well chosen, the ANN could not work well with new patterns.  The only way to know this is precisely to evaluate the ANN with new patterns and calculate the error with these **test patterns**.  Since the test set is available from the beginning, this evaluation with the test set is done at the same time as with the training set (but only the training set is used for training). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to assess how well trained an ANN is, this can be done by evaluating the test set, not the training set.  Usually there is only one set of data, so it is usually divided into two subsets: training and test. There are several alternatives to perform this division; in these tutorials, two different ones will be performed: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hold Out**. In this method, an experiment is performed with a simple partition of the data set, leaving a certain percentage for testing, usually between 20% and 30%. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cross-validation**.  Here, the data set is divided into $k$ disjoint subsets in order to perform the corresponding $k$ experiments.  In the k-th experiment, the $k$-th set is separated for testing, and trained with the remaining $k-1$.  A usual value of $k$ is 10, so you have a 10-fold crossvalidation.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, in this session we will focus on the first one, leaving the second one for a later one.  The hold out technique allows us to split the data set into two subsets: training and test.  The training subset allows to adjust the parameters of the model (connection weights and bias), while the test subset allows to check (test) the behavious of a trained ANN (or, any kind of model that is being used, such as a decision tree) on new patterns, not present in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Normal training in the left, and an overfitting curve on the right](./img/Overfitting.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a well-chosen (and therefore sufficiently representative) training set, the training process could be similar to the figure on the left, with both training and test errors decreasing with each cycle. However, in general, it cannot be ensured that the training set is as noise-free and well-chosen as desirable, so that **overtraining** or **overfitting** often occurs during training.  This can be clearly seen in the figure on the right, where both errors are decreasing until a point is reached where the test error starts to increase.   From that point on, the system starts to overfit. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid overfitting, in ANNs there are a series of techniques known as regularisation techniques, each of which is very different in nature, but all of which aim to avoid overtraining.  Although these techniques are dealt with in much greater depth in other subjects in the programme, e.g. Deep Learning I, in these tutorials we are going to study one of the most well-known techniques, seen in the theory session, called Early Stopping. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this technique, instead of dividing the initial set of samples into 2 subsets, we create 3 subsets: training, validation and test.  The training and test sets perform the functions described above. The purpose of the validation set is to avoid overfitting by controlling the training process, but it is not used to modify weights or bias.  There are several ways to control the training process, here we will use two of them together:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A new criteria for stopping the training process.   With the definition of a new parameter: the maximum number of consecutive cycles without improving the *loss* in the validation set.  If these cycles elapse without improving the best validation *loss* achieved so far, the training is stopped.  As the validation set is not used to modify weights or bias, it gives an estimate of what the test error could be.  Therefore, when the validation error increases, it increases the error in patterns that it has not seen, so it is estimated that the test error would increase, and the network would be overtraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once the training process has stopped, the validation set determines which network is returned.  During all the training cycles, the loss is calculated in the training set, which is necessary to modify weights and bias, but also in the validation set.   Once the training is stopped, the ANN is returned corresponding not to the last cycle, but to the cycle with the lowest error in the validation set.  This is done because it is estimated that this ANN is the one that will give the lowest error in the test set, i.e. the one that will behave better with new patterns and, consequently, the one that will generalise better. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the training process has stopped and an ANN has been returned, the test set can be evaluated to assess how well the ANN has been trained. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important**: The errors (or accuracies, or any metric used) in the training and validation sets are interesting, but the one that really matters is the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, most of the time you have all 3 sets (training, validation and test) from the beginning, so as you evaluate the training and validation sets, you also evaluate the test set, which is useful for plotting graphs. However, these values in the test set cannot be used for decision making. "

    "Therefore, in the training loop it is necessary to keep a reference to the best validation error found so far.  It is also necessary to keep a copy of the ANN that has given that validation error.  Both elements should be updated every cycle when the validation error improves. It is also necessary to keep a counter of how many consecutive cycles the validation error has not improved.\n",

    "As can be seen, the test set cannot have any involvement in the training process. This is the right thing to do, since an ANN with completely new patterns is being evaluated. However, from a very strict point of view, there is one part in this whole process where the test set is having a small influence: in the normalisation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the starting point is a dataset that is first normalised and then split into training/test.  If this is done in this way, the patterns used for testing have some influence on the calculation of the normalisation parameter values, which would not be correct. However, the impact they usually have on these parameters and in general on the performance of the ANN is so low, that this is usually not taken into account and all patterns are normalised together.  In any case, the really correct pipeline to do would be divide the data into train test, to calculate the values of the normalisation parameters only with the training set, and the applied that parameters of normalization to the test prior to run the usual training process. Addtionally, if there is a validation data, it can be used on the normalization, too.\n",

The sum of lengths of both vectors has to be equal to N, and these two vectors have to be disjoint.\n",

This information usually includes title, labels on the axes, legend, markers at each point, line type, colours, etc.  This is usually done through attributes passed as keywords in function calls, such as `axis`, `label`, `line`, `fill`, `marker`, `ticks`, `title`, `xlabel`, `ylabel`, for example: "

There are several methods to do this, the simplest and most commonly used being by using the keyword `layout` in the call to the corresponding function to generate the graph containing all of them.  In this sense, it is the easiest way to generate the graphs independently, and combine them later in a new call using the keyword `layout`, which receives as parameter a tuple with the number of rows and columns of the matrix of graphs, for example:"

From the extension indicated in the file name, Julia saves the graph in the indicated format. Some of the most typical formats are `pdf`, `png` or `ps`.  Although this is a very easy way to save the graphs, not all file types are supported by all backends. At https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/output/ you can check the file formats supported by each backend. For exple with the previous example.\n",
