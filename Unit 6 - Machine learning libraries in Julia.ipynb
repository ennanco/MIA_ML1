    "# The ScikitLearn.jl library\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scikit-learn library is an open-source machine learning library developed for the Python programming language, the first version of which dates back to 2010. It implements many machine learning models, related to classification, regression, clustering or dimensionality reduction. These models include Support Vector Machines (SVM), decision trees, random forests, or k-means. It is currently one of the most widely used libraries in the field of machine learning, due to the large number of functionalities it offers as well as its ease of use, since it provides a uniform interface for training and using models. The documentation for this library is available at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Julia, the ScikitLearn.jl library implements this interface and the algorithms contained in the scikit-learn library, supporting both Julia's own models and those of the scikit-learn library. The latter is done by means of the PyCall.jl library, which allows code written in Python to be executed from Julia in a transparent way for the user, who only needs to have ScikitLearn.jl installed. Documentation for this library can be found at https://scikitlearnjl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, recently, some incompatibilities have been reported with some versions of the SSL library. To avoid potential compatibility issues between Julia, PyCall, and ScikitLearn, we will use a different library for this exercise.\n",
    "The library we will use is MLJ (Machine Learning in Julia), which is not strictly a library but rather a framework that allows the use of various related libraries through a common interface.\n",
    "As a result, the function names used to create and train models remain the same regardless of the specific models being used.\n",
    "In the practical sessions of this course, in addition to ANNs, we will use the following models, available within the MLJ framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "- Decision trees\n",
    "- kNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use these models, it is first necessary to install and import the library:"

    "When creating a kNN model, the main hyperparameter is `K`, which defines the number of neighbors.\n",
    "For decision trees, the main hyperparameter is `max_depth`, which sets the maximum depth of the tree.\n",
    "In the case of decision trees, as shown earlier, there is also a parameter called `rng`. This parameter controls the randomness involved in a specific part of the model construction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, for decision trees, this randomness occurs during the selection of features used to split a node. The `DecisionTree` library uses a random number generator (RNG) for this step, which is updated with each call. As a result, different calls to the function (along with subsequent calls to `fit!`) may produce different models, even with the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To control this randomness and make the process deterministic, it is advisable to provide a fixed integer value as the RNG seed, as shown in the previous example.\n",
    "This ensures that creating a model with a given input-output dataset and a defined set of hyperparameters becomes a reproducible process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it is preferable to control randomness across the entire model development workflow (e.g., cross-validation, training/test splits) by setting a global random seed at the beginning.\n",
    "However, for the purposes of these exercises, we will use the `rng` keyword specifically for the decision tree model.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs have a more complex set of hyperparameters, which depend on the kernel function being used.  \n",
    "First, the hyperparameter `C` controls the trade-off between the margin width and classification error. Lower values allow for more misclassifications (more tolerance), while higher values fit the model more tightly to the data.  \n",
    "In MLJ, this parameter is passed using the keyword `cost` when calling `SVMClassifier`.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel**: In addition to `C`, it uses `gamma`, which controls the influence of each support vector.\n",
    "- **Sigmoid kernel**: Uses `C`, `gamma`, and `coef0`. This kernel behaves similarly to a neural network, where `gamma` and `coef0` influence the shape of the decision function.\n",
    "- **Polynomial kernel**: Uses `C`, `degree` (the degree of the polynomial), `gamma`, and `coef0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical values for these hyperparameters include:  \n",
    "`0.001`, `0.1`, `1`, `10`, `100`, `1000`.\n",

    "Once a model has been created, it must be wrapped in a `machine` object. This object acts as a container that associates the model with the data and handles both training and prediction.  \n",

In this practice, you can use it to indicate which model you want to train, for example, in the `modelCrossValidation` function, symbols will be used to indicate which model to train:\n",
