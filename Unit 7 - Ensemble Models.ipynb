    "# Ensemble Models\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the latest trends in artificial intelligence modelling can be summarised as \"knowledge of the whole or the crowd\". What this somewhat familiar phrase defines is the use of a multitude of so-called \"weak\" models in a meta-classifier. The aim is to generate a \"strong\" model based on the knowledge extracted by the \"weak\" models. For example, although it will be detailed later, multiple, much simpler Decision Trees are developed in a Random Forest. The combination of these ones in the Random Forest exceeds the performance of any of the individual models. The models that emerge in this way, as meta-classifiers or meta-regressors, are generically called **Ensemble models**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is is worth mentioned that these models may not be limited only to decision trees, but may instead be composed of any type of machine learning model that has been seen previously. They can even be mixed models where not all models have been obtained in the same way, but can be created through the combined use of several techniques such as K-NN, SVM, etc. Thus, the first criteria to classifify the ensemble models would be if they are homogeneous or heterogeneous models. However this is not the only criteria to classifity the ensemble models, in this unit, we will explore various ways of generating the models and how to combine them later on. We will also take a closer look at two of the most common techniques within ensemble models such as Random Forest and _XGBoost_."

    "Unlike the first tutorials, where the iris flower problem has been used as a benchmark, in this tutorial we will use a different one. The problem is also included in the UCI repository, although it is also small, the number of variables increases significantly and therefore it will give us some more room to explore. Specifically, it is a classic machine learning problem, which is informally called Rock or Mine? It is a small database consisting of 111 patterns corresponding to rocks and 97 to water mines (simulated as metal cylinders). Each of the patterns consists of 60 numerical measurements corresponding to a section of the sonar sequences. These values are already between 0.0 and 1.0, although it is worth normalising them to be on the safe side. These measurements represent the energy value of different wavelength ranges for a certain period of time.\n",

To solve this, one of the proposals is the use of a weighting in the decision weights. This is because one model may be better than another or more reliable. In order to reflect this point, the output can be modified by multiplying it by a confidence factor within the rule used to make the decisions. This weighting procedure is sometimes also referred to as *Soft Voting* in contrast to *Hard Voting* or unweighted voting. Imagine that each of the classifiers is assigned the same weight, i.e. {1,1,1}.

    "## Model creation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key elements that has not yet been addressed is the creation of the models that will compose the meta-classifier. So far, the approach that has been followed is not very adequate as the input dataset for all models is the same. This has the effect of an obvious lack of diversity in the models since whichever model we create, it will have the same information or \"point of view\" as the others. However, this is not the usual practice. Instead, the set of input patterns is usually divided into smaller sets with which to train one or more techniques in order to reduce the computational cost on the one hand, and to increase the diversity of the models on the other. It is necessary to remember at this point that \"weak\" models do not have to be perfect in all classes and do not even have to cover all possibilities, only models that are quick to train and offer a more or less consistent output.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the way in which to partition the data for the creation of the models, most approaches usually consider two main approaches known as *Bagging* and *Boosting*. In the following, these two approaches will be briefly described.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bagging or boostrap aggregation\n",
    "The technique known as _Bagging_ or selection with replacement was proposed by Breitman in 1996. It is based on the development of multiple models which can be trained in parallel. The key element of these models is that each model is trained on a subset of the training set. This subset of data is drawn randomly with replacement. This last point is particularly important because once an example has been selected from the possibilities, it is placed back among the possibilities so that it can be selected either in the subset being built, or in the subsets of the other models, i.e. non-disjoint sets of examples are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bagging Example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Ensemble_Bagging.svg/440px-Ensemble_Bagging.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that \"experts\" are created on specialised data and depending on the partition. While common, or more frequent, data is correctly covered by all models, it is also true that less frequent data tends not to be in all partitions and may not be covered in all cases. Thus, you would get models that would be more specialised in certain data or have a different point of view, that would be experts in a particular region of the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it will be discussed in more detail later, a well-known technique that uses this approach for the construction of its \"weak\" models is RandomForest. It builds the decision trees that make up the metaclassifier in this way. Any classifier can be used as the basis of a *Bagging* with the class [BaggingClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.BaggingClassifier.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the following code, 10 SVM for classication has been chosen as weak models. Each of those models habe been trained on only 50% of the training patterns, and therefore the variance among them should be increased.\n",

    "As an alternative to extracting complete examples, a vertical partition of the training _dataset_ could be performed, thus extracting features. To implement this alternative, in the `BaggingClassifier` function, the parameter *max_features* must be defined. This approach is used when the number of features is particularly high in order to create simpler models that do not use all the information that is often redundant. It should be noted that this feature extraction procedure for models is done without replacement, i.e. features extracted for one classifier are not re-entered into the list of possibilities until the set for the next classifier is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boosting\n",
    "The other major family of techniques for ensemble metamodelling is what is known as *Boosting*. In this case, the approach is slightly different, since the aim is to create a chain of classifiers. The key element of this type of classifier is to find that each new classifier is more specialised in the patterns that the previous models have missed. Therefore, as in the previous case, a subset of patterns is selected from the original set. However, this process is done sequentially and without replacement. This point is crucial since, as mentioned above, the idea is to eliminate those patterns that are already correctly classified and to obtain more specific models that concentrate on those examples that are less frequent or that have been incorrectly classified in a previous step. Thus, as in *Bagging*, the underlying idea of this approach is that not all models have to have all patterns as a basis, but unlike _Bagging_, this process is linear because of the dependency in the construction of the models. \n",

    "\n",
    "Subsequently, to obtain the combination of the models, the Majority Vote with weights is used. In this approach, the weights are established with an iterative approximation system. There are many examples that use this type of technique, such as [AdaBoost](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier.html) or [Gracient Tree Boosting](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html). In both cases what is done is an adjustment of the weights with a technique based on the Descending Gradient. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of AdaBoost, the algorithm starts by giving a weight to all the instances of the training set. With this weighted set, a classifier is trained with the original data. Depending on the errors made, the weights of the original set are adjusted and a new copy of the classifier is trained, but on the adjusted data, which will focus more on the instances that have been classified incorrectly. In the case of `scikit learn`, the algorithm implemented is known as [AdaBoost-SAMME](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/SII-2-3-A8-Zhu.pdf) proposed by Zhu et.al. in 2009. As a particularity of this implementation, the *loss* function used is an exponential one. This is the one that will be used to calculate the weighting of the errors made, as well as the weight of the classifiers in the meta-classifier. In general terms, the output will be the most voted by the classifiers based on the weighting of each of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Tree Boosting is a different approach to the use of Boosting. It builds a tree where the nodes of the tree set the criteria for, for example, in the case of classification refer to the `logistic-likelihood` of a given pattern. In this way, each of the nodes of the tree makes a classification which is adjusted on the basis of the residual errors that are made by adjusting the weights of the different classifiers in the tree. This division is carried out for each of the available features, performing a recursive procedure by training several classifiers in this way. Subsequently, to make the decision, it is based on the responses of the classifiers it has passed through. The main difference with AdaBoost is that in this case the output is the probabilities of the classes which are summed to give the most likely answer rather than the answer over the instances.\n",

    "## Techniques integrating the Ensemble approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the best-known and currently used algorithms are based on this type of approach. Among these approaches, perhaps the most famous and widely used are those based on the generation of simple Decision Tress (DT). The reason for the use of the trees is their easy interpretation, as well as the speed of calculation and training. In the following we will see the two approaches known today in this sense, ***Random Forest*** and ***XGBoost***.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Forest\n",
    "This algorithm, proposed by Breitman and Cutler in 2006 on the basis of an earlier publication by Ho in 1995 (_Random Subspaces_), is the paradigm ensemble technique. The algorithm joins into an ensemble a set of simple classifiers that take the form of Decision Trees. These classifiers are trained following a **bagging** approach, and can therefore be trained in parallel. Combining the output of the algorithms is done for classification problems by means of the most voted option among the \"experts\" or, if it is a regression problem, by means of the arithmetic mean of the answers. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is an algorithm that needs the adjustment of very few hyperparameters to obtain very good results in almost any type of problem. In general, the most important value is the number of estimators and therefore the number of partitions to be made of the training set. Several authors point out that this number of estimators should be *$\\sqrt{\\textrm{#feature}}$* for classification problems, and *$\\frac{\\textrm{#feature}}{3}$* for regression problems. However, he also points out that the technique would saturate between 500 and 1000 trees and no matter how much it is increased it would not improve results. However, this last point has only been tested empirically on certain data sets and, therefore, should be taken with caution as it has no mathematical justification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the usual bagging process, the Random Forest also includes a second splitting mechanism. Once the patterns that will form part of the training set of the decision tree have been selected, only a subset of random features (*features*) are available for each node of the tree. This increases the diversity of the trees in the forest and focuses on the overall performance with a small variance in the results. This mechanism makes it possible to quantitatively assess the individual performance of each tree in the forest and its variables. Therefore, the importance of each variable can be measured. This measure that calibrates the participation of each variable in the nodes of the tree in decision-making is called impurity and measures the difference between the different branches of the tree when partitioning the examples. Sometimes, this same measure is used as a measure for the selection of variables by taking the measure in all the trees of the forest of the participation and importance by means of a filtering like those seen in the previous unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the calculation of this measure of impurity, there are different approaches. For example, `scikit learn` uses a measure it calls **Gini**. The latter is the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen item in the dataset if it were randomly labelled according to the distribution of classes in the dataset. It is calculated as:\n",
    "$$G = \\sum_{i=1}^C p(i) * (1 - p(i))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C$ is the number of classes and $p(i)$ is the probability of randomly selecting an element of class $i$. A good example of how to calculate the impurity of the branches can be seen in the following [link](https://victorzhou.com/blog/gini-impurity/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, on the example used in this unit, we will run a *Random Forest* model with the `scikit learn` implementation. The most important parameters of this implementation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***n_estimator***, marking the number of trees to be generated or the number of *bagging* partitions.\n",
    "- ***criterion***, measure of node impurity. By default Gini is used, but it can be changed to gained entropy.\n",
    "- max_depth***, allows to limit the maximum depth of the trees in order to limit the number of variables to use.\n",
    "- ***min_sample_split***, for each decision tree, how many patterns are needed to perform an internal split in the *Decision Trees*.\n",
    "- bootstrap***, you can use the *bagging* or *bootstrap* approach to build the trees but if this property is false, then it uses the whole training set to generate the trees. In case of a True value, the following properties are taken into account:\n",
    "    + ***max_samples***, number of examples to extract from the original set to build the training set of the estimator, the default value is equal to the number of patterns but remember that the same can be extracted several times as it is a selection with replacement giving variability.\n",
    "    + ***oob_score***, *out of bag* measure for estimating generalisation. Those samples that have not been part of the training of an estimator can be used to calculate a validation measure, and averaged across all estimators to see how general the constructed forest is.\n",

This implementation is known as ***XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)*** , which has stood out especially in competitions such as the Kaggle platform for its speed in obtaining results and robustness. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ***XGBoost*** will be a similar ensemble to Random Forest but uses a different base classifier known as CART (classification and regression trees) instead of *Decision Trees*. This change comes from the need for the algorithm to obtain the probability of the decisions, as was the case with *Gradient Tree Boosting*. The other fundamental change in this algotimo, since it is based on *Gradient Tree Boosting*, is the change from *bagging* to *boosting* strategy for the creation of the classifier training sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, this technique performs an additive training approach whose weights are adjusted based on a **Declining Gradient** on a *loss* function to be defined. By adding the *loss* function with the regularisation term, the second derivative of the functions can be calculated in order to update the classification weights of the different trees. The calculation of this gradient thus allows the adjustment of the values of the classifiers that are generated following a given one in order to allow the weights to focus attention on the patterns that are incorrectly classified. The mathematical details of the implementation can be found in this [link](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/model.html).\n",
