    "## The curse of dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main problems in machine learning is what is known as the curse of dimensionality or the curse of dimensions. This problem arises from the moment in which one tries to improve an approximation by simply using more variables. Maybe you could, but most probably you can't. This is where the curse of dimensionality comes in. It is here that the curse is incurred since, **as the number of characteristics or dimensions increases, the amount of data needed to obtain an accurate generalisation increases exponentially. ** However, before you can tackle the problem, you need to know where it comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Performance behaviour when the number of variables is increased](./img/unit8/Perfomance_Dimension_plot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dimensionality of problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Rarely do the impact that a given variable will have on an optimisation process come to mind. Take for example a case where there are 5 observations for a given variable **X**, and these observations are uniformly distributed in space. Thus each of the observations will try to represent $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the said space.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./img/unit8/Sampling_Examples.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "hen adding another **Y** variable (moving to a two-dimensional space) in order to maintain the same distance between them, i.e. the same rate of representativeness of the space, the number of samples should be increased to 25. With a third one, 125 samples would be needed to explore the space under the same conditions, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the present problem increases exponentially the more dimensions we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The curse\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens in a real problem? Well, it is usually not possible to increase the number of samples to maintain the representativeness of the sample points and the equidistance. That is why, if we add a new feature but do not provide enough points, the result would be a more complex model but with an impoverished performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this statement can be clearly seen in the following example in which we try to classify between images of cats and dogs. If only one dimension is taken into account, the examples are uniformly distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](./img/unit8/Doom_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case there are 10 samples covering the whole space. But, if you increase one dimension, that distribution becomes something like the following figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./img/unit8/Doom_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation might lead one to think that a new dimension would make it even easier to divide the space. For example, adding a third dimension to the previous problem would give something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./img/unit8/Doom_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the result is linearly separable as can be seen in the following image.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./img/unit8/Doom_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The erroneous conclusion that can be drawn is that the higher the dimensionality is increased, the easier the separation on the basis of features will be. Note how the distribution of the data has changed: while in one dimension there are 2 samples per five-sample interval mentioned above, in three-dimensional space there are barely 0.08 samples per interval (10/125). Therefore, it is more complicated to find counter examples on the same side of the classifier. The problem arises when we project this data to a lower dimensional space as happens when any artificial neural network is applied when creating a classifier. In that situation the result would be similar to the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./img/unit8/Doom_5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in the following figure, the classifier has been overtrained and therefore the result is not as good as it could be for new instances. For example, see the following figure where a simple linear classifier has been applied on fewer dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./img/unit8/Doom_6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to avoid the curse?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no single rule defining how many features should be used in a regression/classification problem. The number will depend on the amount of training data available, the complexity of the decision boundaries and the type of classifier being used. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are mainly two types of approaches in order to reduce dimensionality. These two types are:\n",
    "* projections \n",
    "* transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between one and the other is that, while projections operate on the space defined by the input samples itself, transformations try to modify this space in order to find a transition function that allows a suitable and separable representation of the data.\n",
    "Some of the most common techniques are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) \n",
    "* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) \n",
    "* Independent Components Analysis (ICA) \n",

    "\n",
    "Probably the most widely used dimensionality reduction technique. It can be used both individually and in combination with other techniques. It is a method that transforms data by means of a projection onto a set of orthogonal axes. To do this, the method searches for the best linear combinations of the original variables, trying to maximise the variance along the new variable. For example, the image on the right shows a set of points in three dimensions. These three dimensions, when projected, give the images on the right that allow us to see the variability of the data for each of the axes. The continuous line is the one with the highest variability and, therefore, the one that will be taken as the base or first component. For the second component, among the remaining possibilities, the one that maximises and remains perpendicular (orthogonal) to the first dimension selected will be chosen.\n",

ICA is also a linear dimension reduction method, which transforms the dataset into columns of independent components. Blind source separation and the \"cocktail party problem\" are other names for it. ICA is an important tool in neuroimaging, fMRI and EEG analysis that helps to separate normal signals from abnormal ones.\n",

    "## Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "This linear machine learning algorithm is used for multi-class classification, although it is sometimes used as a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Beware of confusing it with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which is also a dimensionality reduction technique but only applicable to text documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA tries to separate (or discriminate) as best as possible the samples of the training dataset by their class value. Specifically, the model tries to find a linear combination of input variables that achieves the maximum separation of samples between classes (centroids or class means) and the minimum separation of samples within each class. Therefore, its major difference with PCA is that LDA takes the output class into account, while PCA is completely agnostic to this fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the `scikit-learn` library, the implementation of the algorithm allows us to use it to classify or to transform the corresponding data. See the following example:"

    "## t-Distributed Stochastic Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of the NON-linear techniques that are focused on dimensionality reduction. It is usually reserved for high dimensionality problems. While PCA is a linear technique that seeks to maximise variance while preserving large pairwise distances (in other words, things that are different end up being far apart), t-SNE is statistically based and tries to overcome shortcomings of other techniques when it comes to exploring data that have a non-linear structure.\n",

    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts by calculating the probability of similarity of the points in the high-dimensional space (Gaussian function) and calculating the probability of similarity of the points in the low-dimensional space (based on a Cauchy function). The similarity is calculated as the conditional probability that a point $A$ chooses point $B$ as a neighbour if the neighbours are chosen in proportion to their probability density under a Gaussian (normal distribution) centred on $A$. The difference between these conditional probabilities in the higher and lower dimensional space is then minimised for a representation of the data points in the lower dimensional space. To measure the minimisation of the sum of the conditional probability difference, t-SNE minimises the sum of the **Kullback-Leibler divergence** of the global data points using a gradient descent method. This asymmetric statistical function also used in *Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN)* or *Variational Auto Encoders(VAE)* allows optimisation of the distance between probabilistic distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general terms, t-SNE attempts to minimise the divergence between two distributions, the first, a distribution that measures the pairwise similarities of the input objects, and the second, a distribution that measures the pairwise similarities of the corresponding points in the low-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "One point to note is that as a simplification of the Cauchy distribution, it is usually simplified to a single degree of freedom resulting in a t-student distribution, hence the name of the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other point to note is that, after this process, the input features are no longer identifiable, and no inference can be made based solely on the t-SNE result. Hence, it is primarily a data exploration and visualisation technique.\n",

Alternatively, although slower as it has a complexity of $O(N^2)$, the 'exact' method can be used which as the name suggests makes no assumptions or approximations but is the exact value."
